\subsection{Simple Scenario: Binary classification}
\label{sec:4.1}

In the presented scenario, 1,000 (thousand) JPEG files and 1,000 (thousand) PNG files were designated, respectively considered class and counter-class. The files were cataloged on the world wide web.

The proposed work creates an authorial tool aiming at target class pattern recognition for JPEG files. From a training set, it is possible to formulate a hypothesis about the clusters of the target class (JPEG). It is up to the authorial system to estimate the class of an unprecedented cluster. It does this by comparing its features audited in real time and those obtained during the training stage.

\subsection{Complex Scenario: One-against-all method classification}
\label{sec:4.2}

In this scenario, a database was formed containing 16 thousand files, one thousand of each extension presented below.
The files were cataloged on the world wide web. The main objective of the experiment is to simulate a common user's computer. In contemporary times, electronic computers such as desktop computers, cell phones and other devices are not just focused on entertainment. They became indispensable for the fulfillment of domestic, professional, academic and planning tasks.

The hypothesis is that the authorial system is able to differentiate clusters of the target class (JPEG) from other types of files, even though they were not presented during its training phase. The one-against-all method is applied in this complex scenario. In statistical terms, it only matters the segregation of clusters of the target class to the detriment of all other classes.
